# Developer Facebook

Application strives to achieve a basic developer's facebook meaning the following are used: comments, likes/dislikes, registration, profiles, and posts to discuss topics with like minded individuals. This is accomplished through using mongodb, react, nodejs, and express.

## Getting Started

If interested in testing the website, you will need to modify my current URI and githubclientId to your own personalized settings. This is located under DeveloperFacebook/config/default.json. Disregard the production.json, that is purely meant for deploying to heroku.

### Prerequisites

Once the repository is cloned and up in running in your personalized IDE, you will need to do the following command in both the root directory and under client

```
npm install
```

### Running

Once you've installed the prerequisites, simply type in the command below and you'll be up and running. Remember, if you didn't follow the first step you will not be able to register, make posts, and etc.

```
npm run dev
```
